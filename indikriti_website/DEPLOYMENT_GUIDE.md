# Deployment Guide - Indikriti E-commerce

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### For Hostinger (Recommended)

1. **Build the project locally:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload files:**
   - Upload the entire `dist` folder contents to your domain's `public_html` folder
   - Make sure `.htaccess` file is included (it's in the dist folder after build)

3. **Set up custom domain (if needed):**
   - Point your domain to the hosting server
   - No additional configuration needed

### For Other Hosting Services

#### Netlify
1. Connect your Git repository
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. The `netlify.toml` file is already configured

#### Vercel
1. Import your repository
2. Framework: React
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Output directory: `dist`

#### GitHub Pages
1. Install gh-pages: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
2. Add to package.json scripts:
   ```json
   "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist"
   ```
3. Run: `npm run deploy`

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
# Backend API URL (only if you have a backend)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com/api/v1

# Analytics tracking (optional)
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
```

### Backend Integration
The app works in two modes:

1. **With Backend** (Production):
   - Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
   - Implement the required API endpoints

2. **Without Backend** (Demo):
   - No configuration needed
   - Uses comprehensive mock data automatically
